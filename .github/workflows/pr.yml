name: PR Verification

# This workflow runs branch verification checks on pull requests.
# It uses the ob-charts-tool to verify that the PR branch follows
# the required standards for chart versioning and structure.
#
# The workflow will:
# - Fail on critical errors (sequential versioning, build consistency)
# - Pass with warnings (non-critical issues like multiple packages modified)
